#' @title Filter and impute missing values prior to A/B compartment inference with k-nearest neighbor
#' 
#' @description 
#' \code{filterAndImputeWGBS} returns filtered and smoothed signal from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data
#'
#' @details 
#' This function filters and performs Dirichlet smoothing of WGBS signal prior to A/B compartment inference
#'
#' @param obj Input BSseq object
#' @param k The pseudocount to be added for smoothing (default uses Jeffery's prior)
#' @param minCov Minimum coverage of a locus to be smoothed
#' @param minSamp Minimum samples that have sufficient coverage to be smoothed
#' @param rowmax The maximum percent missing data allowed per loci (default = 50%)
#' @param colmax The maximum percent missing data allowed per sample (default = 80%)
#' @param openseafilt Whether to filter loci to just "open sea" CpG loci
#' @param genome The genome (currently only supports hg19)

#' @return Filtered and imputed matrix
