Title: Higher-order chromatin domain inference in single cells from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq
Description: Compartmap performs direct inference of higher-order chromatin
    from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. This package implements a James-Stein estimator
    for computing single-cell level higher-order chromatin domains. Further, we
    utilize random matrix theory as a method to de-noise correlation matrices to
    achieve a similar "plaid-like" patterning as observed in Hi-C and scHi-C data.
